# AddonTemplate
Template for small, simple standalone addons for World of Warcraft.  

To use this as a base for your own addons, you can either fork it, import it into your own user area or organization here on GitHub, or use it as a template. I do however not recommend the template option, as only the two former will allow you to add this original as a remote in your project, and thus import any updates or changes from here directly. If you're not familier with git, well then it sucks to be you and copypasting is your only option!  

Good luck and have fun!
