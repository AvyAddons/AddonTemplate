# AddonTemplate
Template for small, simple standalone addons for World of Warcraft.  

To use this as a base for your own addons, you can either fork it, import it into your own user area or organization here on GitHub, or use it as a template. I do however _not_ recommend the template option, as only the two former will allow you to add this original as a remote in your project, and thus import any updates or changes from here directly. The best option is the GitHub import option, and you should choose the intended project name as you import, and then follow the guide below to further tailor it to your own project. 

If you're not familier with git, well then it sucks to be you and copypasting is your only option!  

Good luck and have fun!  

### **How to prepare the template**
To use this template, you need to rename some files and folders, and do a search and replace within all the files for a few select keywords.
* Rename the folder `AddonTemplate` to your project name, if you haven't already.
* Rename the folder `YOUR_ADDON` to the exact folder name of your addon.
* Rename the file `YOUR_ADDON.toc` so that you get the exact folder name of your addon, with the `.toc` file ending.
* Run a search and replace on all the files in the entire folder structure for `YOUR_ADDON`, and replace it with the exact folder name of your addon.
* Run a search and replace on all the files in the entire folder structure for `YOUR_NAME`, and replace it with your name, or gamertag or whatever you want the author of the addon to be listed as.
